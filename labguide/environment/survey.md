## Annual environment survey  

1.  1. In order to ensure that the
    environment remains welcoming and productive for everyone, we will
    conduct a yearly survey of lab members regarding the lab environment
    (link to example). This
    survey will be completed at the end of the Spring Quarter (in June).
