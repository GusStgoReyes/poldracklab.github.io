## Administrative requests

The assigned administrative
    assistant for the lab (currently Diana Savastio) should be the default
    person to send any administrative requests. In the past, we have had
    issues where requests were coming from multiple members of our lab
    and/or to multiple administrative staff, which was not being
    sufficiently mindful of time and busy schedules of the
    administrative staff. Therefore, in general, you should not directly
    contact other departmental administrators with requests unless
    directed by the administrative assistant or Dr. Poldrack. However,
    there may be exceptions to this that justify contacting other staff
    directly (e.g., CNI-related questions directly to CNI staff like
    Laima Baltusis).  

## Lab procedures
